# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have watched lecture 1-2 videos so far. This has helped me grasp key concepts and apply them effectively in practical assignments.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I have scheduled my video watching sessions is in evening at home or cafe, typically for a duration of 1-1,5 hours per session. This schedule helps me maintain a routine and ensures I am consistent with my learning.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

So far, I have been diligent in completing all assignments ahead of deadlines and actively participating in discussion forums. These habits have helped me stay on top of the course material and engage deeply with the content. I plan to maintain this proactive approach throughout the semester to ensure I understand all concepts thoroughly.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to change my habit of skipping the initial planning phase before diving into coding for my practical tasks. Often, this leads to needing to backtrack and rewrite code, which is inefficient. Going forward, I will spend more time designing algorithms and writing pseudocode before I start the actual coding process. Also should stop using phone to watch lectures and prefer laptop and pay more attention to online lectures

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I'm currently struggling with laziness and procrastination and the new incremental format for submitting code changes to GitHub(commit), such as effective comments in complex code. To improve, I will utilize more resources like online forums, seek feedback from peers, and spend more time practicing coding exercises and improve my schedule.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I am doing really well in attending classes and solving problems during the lesson compared to **Programming I** and applying best practices in code documentation and style consistency. My responses during the class consistently receive positive feedback. I will continue to focus on these aspects and also start enhance other aspects.
