## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've started breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. This has helped me tackle complex programming assignments more effectively and reduced my overall stress. Additionally, I now dedicate specific time slots for studying and coding practice, which has improved my time management.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to work on reducing procrastination and start assignments earlier. Often, I find myself rushing to complete tasks last minute, which affects the quality of my work. Developing a more disciplined approach and sticking to a consistent study schedule is crucial for improving my performance.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am consistently attending lectures and practicals, and I actively participate in class discussions. This has helped me understand the concepts better and stay engaged with the course material. I will continue to be proactive in seeking help from tutors and classmates whenever I encounter difficulties.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop relying heavily on online tutorials and solutions for my assignments. While they can be helpful, I need to ensure that I fully understand the concepts and can apply them independently. Instead, I should focus more on understanding the underlying principles and practicing more on my own.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I suggest incorporating more real-world projects and case studies into the curriculum. This would provide practical experience and help students understand how the theoretical concepts apply in real-world scenarios. Additionally, more opportunities for collaborative projects would be beneficial, as teamwork is a crucial skill in the IT industry.
