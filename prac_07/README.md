## Lessons Learned About Clean Code

Throughout my studies in CP1404, I have learned several key principles about writing clean code:

- **Readability Matters**: Ensuring that code is easy to read and understand is crucial. This includes using meaningful
  variable names, maintaining a clean and organized code structure, and adding comments to explain complex logic.

- **Consistency is Key**: Applying a consistent coding style across the entire codebase helps make the code more uniform
  and easier to manage. This includes following consistent naming conventions and adhering to language-specific style
  guidelines.

- **Refactor Regularly**: Continuously refactoring code to improve and simplify its structure can significantly enhance
  the maintainability and efficiency of the software.
