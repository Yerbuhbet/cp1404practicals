## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was initially inconsistent. Some tasks took longer than expected, especially those that required understanding new concepts or involved debugging.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the course progressed, my estimates became more accurate. I learned to better assess the complexity of tasks and account for potential challenges. This improvement was due to increased familiarity with the types of problems we were solving and a more structured approach to planning.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable components to make more accurate time estimates. Additionally, I realized that estimating is a skill that improves with practice and reflection on past experiences.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed by others taught me the value of different perspectives. It highlighted areas of my code that could be improved, such as readability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices. It also reinforced the importance of writing clean, well-documented code that others can easily understand.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code helped me develop a critical eye for identifying issues and areas for improvement. It also enhanced my understanding of good coding practices and how to communicate constructive feedback effectively.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Review on Practical 4]

### Explanation

In this review, I provided detailed feedback on improving code readability and suggested specific refactoring techniques to make the code more efficient. I also highlighted the importance of consistent naming conventions.

### Good Code Review 2

[Review on Practical 6]

### Explanation

This review was valuable because I identified a potential logic error that could have led to incorrect results in certain scenarios. I also offered alternative approaches to solving the problem, which were more aligned with best practices discussed during the course.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge of the subject, I would include more collaborative coding exercises earlier in the course. This would allow students to get comfortable with code reviews and working in teams from the start, reinforcing the importance of clear communication and shared understanding of coding practices.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I consistently applied the coding standards and best practices taught in the course. I also put significant effort into thoroughly testing my code, which resulted in fewer bugs and more reliable implementations. Additionally, I made sure to reflect on each task, learning from both successes and challenges, which helped me improve over time.
